### To run this notebook, make sure you are in a venv ```python 3.13``` first to override overwriting global packages (if you care)

#### **Steps:**

**1 - Add a ```.env``` file with:**
```ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="PLACE YOUR KEY HERE"``` <br>
**2 - Change your portfolio tickers under the ```Portfolio()``` class** <br>
**3 - Do not worry about running local packages as they are done in the notebook itself** <br>
**4 - Run all cells and wait for the results**
